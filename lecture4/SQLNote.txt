# Create sql file:
touch flights.sql

# Run sqlite3 (have sqlite3 installed):
sqlite3 flights.sql

# Create table:
CREATE TABLE flights (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    origin TEXT NOT NULL,
    destination TEXT NOT NULL,
    duration INTEGER NOT NULL
);

# Show all tables in database:
.tables

# Get data from table:
SELECT * FROM flights;
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE duration > 500;
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE duration > 500 AND destination = "Paris";
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE duration > 500 OR destination = "Paris";
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin in ("New York", "Lima");


# Insert into table:
INSERT INTO flights (origin, destination, duration) VALUES ("New York", "London", 415);

# Format table nicer in SQLite:
.mode columns
.headers yes

# Functions:
AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, ...

# Update data:
UPDATE flights
    SET duration = 430
    WHERE origin = "New York"
    AND destination = "London";

# Delete data:
DELETE FROM flights WHERE desination = "Tokyo";

# Other Clauses:
LIMIT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, ...

# JOIN:
JOIN / INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN

# Create an index on table to optimize queries: 
CREATE INDEX name_index ON passengers (last);

SELECT * FROM users
